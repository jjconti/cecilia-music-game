INTRODUCTION:

Hi! My name is Juanjo Conti and I am from Argentina. When the challenge started
I was travelling round Brasil. When I was back I founded that my friends weren't
going to get in and I decided to make a solo entry.

I knew I was going to have a bussy week, so I desided to make a light but funny
game. I hope you enjoy it.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

At the begining of a level you'll listen a song (ok, some notes).
Use the 1-6 keys to select the right length pieces of string needed to
reproduce that song (order is important!).

Backspace to erase the last piece added.
Space to listen again the song and P key for pause it.
